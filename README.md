# How to install

Arbi aims to keep installment easy and beginner friendly as possible. The process is simple. 

There are 2 versions of Arbi. 
* Basic: The basic version is Arbi with its main features, and doesn't include the science window, and learn feature.
* Full: The full version includes all of the features in Arbi; but requires you to have Adobe Acrobat Reader installed (free version works fine too). 

### Step 0. (For people trying the full version)
* Go to https://get.adobe.com/reader/ and download _Adobe Acrobat Reader DC_. It's completely free. If you already have Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, you can skip this step.
